An online game written with JavaScript in which 2 players play each turn to compete. 
For each turn, a player can move from one to three boxes (horizontally or vertically) before ending their turn. They obviously can not pass through obstacles directly.

If a player passes over a box containing a weapon, they leave their current weapon on site and replace it with the new one.
